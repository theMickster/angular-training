# Plualsight's Angular Forms

From the course webpage
> Forms are a vital part of web applications, since they're the primary way you collect data from your users. You want your forms to look good and offer a simple, smooth experience. In this course, Angular Forms, you'll learn how to create template-driven forms using the Angular framework. First, you'll discover how to style them, use data binding and then validate your forms. Next, you'll explore observables and posting your forms to a server. Finally, you'll learn about third-party form controls which offer much more functionality than standard HTML5. By the end of this course, you'll be able to build great looking forms that offer your users a simple way to input any data.
